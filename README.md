ðŸ‘‹ Hello everyone! 

This is Masudul Haque. [@saadixl](https://saadixl.me) has been my internet handle since I started creating different intetnet accounts.

I've completed my BSc in Computer Science in 2015 and in 2022 I've completed my Masters in Information Technology. For last 10 years, I have been working in different software companies in different roles and my focus always had been producing softwares which would make lives easier.

My area of focus is full-stack web application development but that's not limited. Occassionally I try to work with hybrid mobile applications, machine learning etc.
