ðŸ‘‹ Hello everyone! 

I am Masudul Haque, also known as [@saadixl](https://saadixl.me) across various internet platforms. I obtained my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science in 2015 and recently completed my Masters in Information Technology in 2022. Throughout the past decade, I have been employed in various software companies, holding different positions, and my primary objective has always been to develop software that simplifies life.

My expertise lies in full-stack web application development, although I also dabble in other areas such as hybrid mobile applications and machine learning. If you are interested in connecting with me, please do so via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saadixl).
